    <h2>The Future of Lake Ronkonkoma</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-8">
		<h3>Pollution Prevention</h3>
		<p>Between 1986 and 2006, developing the area around Lake Ronkonkoma brought challenges. In 2006 elected officials,from all the municipalities, along with several citizens from many community groups formed the Suffolk County Lake Ronkonkoma Advisory Committee.  The goals of the committee focused of preserving the integrity of the lake.  Members of the Ronkonkoma Chamber of Commerce have acted as advisors to this group for many years.</p><p>An updated Clean Lake Study is due out shortly and should make recommendations for continued improvements and provide ways to maintain the area for the future.</p> 
		<p>At the beginning of the 21st Century, LakeRonkonkoma.org began an Annual Lake Clean up event on the Sunday before Memorial Day weekend.  Over the years, they were joined by hundreds of community volunteers, local businesses, with support from the municipalities.  Continued awareness that it takes thought and consideration to keep Lake Ronkonkoma beautiful, and with help from the entire community, the area should continue to improve.</p>
